## First Run

01. Run the **XBOFS.win** application and launch the **Driver Manager** using the highlighted link

02. The **Driver Manager** will request Administrative permissions when it launches. Once the **Driver Manager** is running your screen
    should appear as so once you've moved the **Driver Manager** window over:

03. As per the instructions in the **Driver Manager** connect your Razer Atrox XBO or Madcatz TE2 XBO Controller and then click the 
    appropriate button to install the WinUSB driver for your device. A progress dialog should appear and driver installation will begin

04. The **XBOFS.win** application will detect your controller and this is indicative of a successful WinUSB driver installation

05. Although your controller should now work correctly, it is best to wait until the progress dialog disappears before closing the 
    **Driver Manager**. You can click the relevant tab in the **XBOFS.win** to view details of the attached controller while you wait

06. Once the progress dialog has disappeared the *Diagnostics* area of the **Driver Manager** will update. A result of code of 0 or -13 are
    both indicative of success. Other results may indicate an issue. You can now close the **Driver Manager** or, if you have another
    supported controller of a different make (I.e. You own both a Razer Atrox XBO *and* a Madcatz TE2 XBO), return to step 3 and
    repeat the WinUSB driver installation proccess for the other controller

07. Once the **Driver Manager** has closed the main tab in the **XBOFS.win** application should update to indicate that the WinUSB
    driver has been installed. If you need to access the **Driver Manager** again you can do so from the *File* menu
